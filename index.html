    <h3>Why I Am Here</h3>

       <P>I am here because I was recently furloughed from my job as a Flight Attendant with United Airlines due to the
          Covid-19 pandemic that we are all expieriencing. Before hand, I've always wanted to do something else with my time 
          because my schedule was so flexible, but never decided what that should be. With the Corona Virus pandemic being as 
          devasting as it has been to the aviation industry, the need to find a second option became more evident.
          After coming across an advertisement for the GWU Coding Bootcamp, and the added free time I then
          had due to being furloughed, I had the eureka moment that I had been searching for. Cheers to new beginnings. 
       </P>
