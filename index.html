    <h3>Why I'm Here</h3>

       <P>I'm here because I was just furloughed from my job as a flight attendant with United Airlines.
          I've always wanted to do something else with my time since my schedule was so felxible, but with 
          the covid pandemic being as devasting as it has to the aviation industry, I had a much better
          incentive to find a second option. Here I am to learn something totally new that has always interested
          me. Cheers to the new journey!
       </P>
